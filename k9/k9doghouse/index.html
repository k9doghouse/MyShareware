      <h4>Code Breaker / Mastermind with Words (MMwW2)</h4>

      CodeBreaker was my first published shareware. It was included in a Japanese CD insert to a programming magazine in 1998. The title for the article was <strong><u>The Best American Shareware for 1998</u></strong>. An
      American magazine also
      followed later that year with CodeBreaker on their CD. At that time I was working for AOL as a TechRep and on special projects. <br /><br /> It was called CodeBreaker and was like the Mastermind boardgame with numbers instead of colored
      pegs. Since then, I have made some variation of this
      puzzle game in Pascal, Turbo Pascal for Macintosh (Thank you Philipe Khan), CodeWarrior C, C++, Java, Swift, and even a text-only version in Perl. MMwW2 (Master Mind with Words II) is my current effort.<br><br>My wife and I started playing
      the game using four or five
      letter words as we drove long distances to visit family and friends. She would think of a word and I would try to guess the word. She would answer with my clues; correct-letter and correct-position and then included-letter but
      incorrect-position. Today, I play MMwW2 on my iPhone whenever I have to wait for an appointment, or whenever I want a distraction.

      <h4 class="slidefour">Slide Four</h4>

      This is a simple game that often has no way to solve the puzzle. I'm working on developing a way to only include solvable puzzles. This puzzle game's objects are all manufactured in Swift 4.2 code without using the xcode 10 IB.  Keep calm and code on. And, listen to more Elmore James!

      <h4>River Gauge</h4>
      Presently, we live a short hike to the Mississippi River, allbeit, on the incorrect side of the river. The last flood came within a half mile of our house and our road was a dead end for weeks. I like to be able to call up the river gauge
      when it rains. We are not in Arizona anymore, Toto.
